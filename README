DBMS_JDBC
============
This project consists of two main parts DataBase Management System (DBMS) and Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC).
The Project support XML, JSON and ProtocolBuffer format.
The Project uses 'log4j' to show actions and exceptions.

DBMS takes a SQL statement then it parses the statement and executes it.
DBMS consists of three parts 1) Parser. 2) Machine(Logic). 3) File Manipultion.
It supports (VarChar, Int, Float, Date) dataTypes.
It supports (Create, Drop, Use, Alter, Insert, Update, Delete, Select, Union) commands.

Parser is mainly like a finite state machine such every state takes you to the next one.
Command is a super class that mainly contains data given in the SQL statement.
Machine contains the logic to execute commands.

*) DBMS Program Flow (MVC DesignPattern):
=================
1) Controller gets the SQL statement, passes it to the parser.
2) Parser checks the syntax, gets information in the statement and returns a Command that contains this information.
3) Controller gets the Command and passes it to the Machine part.
4) Machine calls File Manipulation part to check Database or Table exsitance.
5) If so, it executes the statement.
